# hellojava

This is a mono-repo containing multiple projects used by me (Vitor Freitas) for the study of Java and related frameworks.

The projects contained here should not be considered a reference for Java/coding best practices, since they all have educational purposes with lots of commentary (that would be unnecessary in prod) explaining what is happening behind the scenes and why things work that way/

Unless specified, all the code was either developed by me (Vitor) or written along a video lesson.
