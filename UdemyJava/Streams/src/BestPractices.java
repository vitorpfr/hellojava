public class BestPractices {
    // There are many ways to write lambdas:
    // - specify type or not,
    // - using a return statement with curly braces or not,
    // - using lambda expressions that contain one statement or multiple statements
    // - using parenthesis when a lambda has only one argument or not

    // tradeoff of verbosity vs conciseness
    // usually it is better to fall on the side of conciseness, but keeping in mind it is better to be verbose when
    // the code starts to get "cryptic"
    // however, the best practice is always be consistent: if the file is using one pattern, repeat it
